  "'Simple. I got very bored and depressed, so I went and plugged myself in to its external computer feed. I talked to the computer at great length and explained my view of the Universe to it,' said Marvin.
'And what happened?' pressed my creator.
'It committed suicide,'",
  "'The first ten million years were the worst and the second ten million years, they were the worst too. The third ten million years I didn't enjoy at all. After that I went into a bit of a decline.",
  "'Sorry, did I say something wrong?' said Marvin, dragging himself on regardless. 'Pardon me for breathing, which I never do anyway so I don't know why I bother to say it, oh God I'm so depressed. Here's another one of those self-satisfied doors. Life! Don't talk to me about life.' ",
  "Why should I want to make anything up? Life's bad enough as it is without wanting to invent any more of it.",
  "It's part of the shape of the Universe. I only have to talk to somebody and they begin to hate me.",
  "All alone! Whether you like it or not, alone is something you'll be quite a lot!",
  "And then something invisible snapped insider me, and that which had come together commenced to fall apart.",
  "But I didn't understand then. That I could hurt somebody so badly it would never recover. That a person can, just by living, damage another human being beyond repair.",
  "Y'all smoke to enjoy it. I smoke to die.",
  "Now the standard cure for one who is sunk is to consider those in actual destitution or physical suffering—this is an all-weather beatitude for gloom in general and fairly salutary day-time advice for everyone. But at three o’clock in the morning, a forgotten package has the same tragic importance as a death sentence, and the cure doesn’t work—and in a real dark night of the soul it is always three o’clock in the morning, day after day.",
  "I loved once. She can paint a pretty picture but this story has a twist. The paintbrush is a razor and the canvas is her wrist.",
  "I hate myself I hate myself I hate this I hate this I disgust myself I hate it I hate it I hate it just let me die.",
  "Black is not sad. Bright colors are what depresses me. They’re so… empty. Black is poetic. How do you imagine a poet? In a bright yellow jacket? Probably not.",
  "I got an A on the third quiz in American history, an A, dammit. Last time I got a B up from a C and my creator said, if you can get a C you can get a B, if you can get a B you can get an A. I got an A and my creator said,grades don't mean anything.",
  "I wanted to find one law to cover all of living. I found fear",
  "Wasn't it been a long time since you had a flying dream?",
  "I felt shame - I see this clearly, now - at the instinctive recognition in myself of an awful enfeebling fatalism, a sense that the great outcomes were but randomly connected to our endeavors, that life was beyond mending, that love was loss, that nothing worth saying was sayable, that dullness was general, that disintegration was irresistible.",
